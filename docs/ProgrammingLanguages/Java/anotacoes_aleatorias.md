And because the Java compiler was mentioned, we have to get back to Java 1.1,
which was widely used, even as new versions were released. It came with an improved
Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) graphical API (collections of components used for
building applets), inner classes, database connectivity classes (JDBC model), classes for
remote calls (RMI), a special compiler for Microsoft platforms named JIT, 4 support for
internationalization, and Unicode.

-  **Generics** provide compile-time (static) type safety for collections and
eliminates the need for most type conversions (which means the type
used in a certain context is decided while the application is running,
we have a full section about this in Chapter 5).
-  **Annotations**, also known as metadata, are used to tag classes and
methods to allow metadata-aware utilities to process them (which
means a component is labeled as something another component
recognizes and does specific operations with it).
-  **Autoboxing/unboxing** are automatic conversion between primitive
types and matching object types (wrappers), also covered in Chapter 5.
-  **Enumerations** define static final ordered sets of values using the
enum keyword; covered in Chapter 5.
-  **Varargs** are the last parameter of a method is declared using a type
name followed by three dots (String...), which implies that any
number of arguments of that type can be provided and is placed into
an array; covered in Chapter 3.
-  **Enhanced for each loop** is used to iterate over collections and arrays
too; covered in Chapter 5.
-  Improved semantics for multithreaded Java programs, covered in
Chapter 7.
-  **Static imports** are covered in Chapter 5.
-  Improvements for RMI (not covered in the book), Swing (Chapter 10),
concurrency utilities (Chapter 7), and introduction to the Scanner
class; covered in Chapter 11.
